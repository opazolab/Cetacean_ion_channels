Welcome! In this folder, you'll discover all the supplement
ary files related to our research project titled "Evolution 
of Ion Channels in Cetaceans: A Natural Experiment in the T
ree of Life."

Contained within the "Scripts_Cetacean_Evolution_March2024"
directory are two essential files: the pipeline file and a 
script folder. Within the pipeline file, you'll find detail
ed steps and commands that we utilized to execute various s
oftware tools essential to our study and in the script fold
er there are three folders containing every script used in 
our pipeline for processing and creating files that are use
d as input files for TMHMM, Rps-blast, Pal2nal and PAML, as
well as scripts used in CAFE. The folders are named accordi
ng to the step in which you should use them, and in the Pip
eline file, you can read the description of when and how to
use them.

Within the "Supplementary_Table_S1.xlsx" file, you can find
